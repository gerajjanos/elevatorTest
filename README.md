# elevatorTest
Hello. 
I would like to say a few words about this test project:
  - Is it complete and fully functional? : no, it isn't because there are a few things that I couldn't solve in this timespan.
  - Are the main functionalities working? : yes, they do, and I did not delete any of the test "console.logs".
  - About the UI: i'm not a designer as you can see :))
